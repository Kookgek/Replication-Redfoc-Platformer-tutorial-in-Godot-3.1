Rebuild of first level of Contruct 2 2D platformer tutorial by Redfoc, in Godot engine 3.1.

I've originally followed a tutorial for a side scrolling 2d platformer <a href="https://redfoc.com/platformer-series-construct-2-tutorial/"> made by Redfoc</a> 

I've replicated the first level in Game engine Godot 3.1 as close as the original.
